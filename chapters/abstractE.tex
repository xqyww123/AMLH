Firstly, the paper proposes a new axiomatic system, Noesis system
, where theorems describe the correspondence between program and
abstract semantics of it. Noesis system allows to 
prove property of program by proof of 
the abstract semantics, so that formal verification of program
could be reduced to formal verification of the abstract semantics,
and formal verification becomes easier as a result.
Then, the paper produces a new method based on the Noesis
theories, constructing programs with abstract semantics
via deducting the Noesis theorems. Programs produced by the method
 have nice performance of time and space, and can be formal 
analysed by formal analysis of its abstract semantics, which
  much more easier.
Finally, the paper implements a tool\ \Eamlh\ to apply the method.
\Eamlh\ can generate and compile programs into EOS.IO, a
 blockchain based smart contract platform, with nice performance
  of execution and facility for formal analysis.

Axioms of Noesis system consist of correspondence from set of
primitive instructions and constants to abstract semantics of
  them.
Theorems of Noesis system represents the correspondence of
abstract semantics for the programs composed of primitive
  instructions and constants.
While abstract semantics of instructions and constants in
  axioms represent
behavior of instructions of certain execution environment 
  correctly, theorems reveal abstract semantic of composed
  program correctly.
Given the map from primitive instructions and constants to
the destination platform, composed program in Noesis system
could be compiled into the destination, through the map.

%Noesis 逻辑可以实现在经典逻辑上或者说作为经典逻辑的子集，
%在本文中它被实现在 HOL 定理证明器的 HOL 逻辑上，
%程序的抽象语义被自然地表达为 HOL 证明器上的数学对象，
%可以使用 HOL 证明器分析与证明抽象语义的性质。
%于是对程序的形式化验证变为对其抽象语义的形式化验证，而抽象语义是易于
%分析的，于是形式化验证就被有效简化。
